## ü¶æ Doosan Robot move block

This project demonstrates a **Pick & Place system** using the **Doosan M0609 collaborative robot**.  
The robot detects the Z-contact point of each block using **force sensing**, and then sorts the blocks into columns based on height.

- **Input**: 3x3 block grid  
- **Output**: Sorted into 3 columns based on contact height (`z`)

## üß±ü§ñ Doosan Robot LEGO
This project demonstrates a Pick & Place system using the Doosan M0609 collaborative robot.
The robot picks up LEGO blocks using force sensing to detect contact, then places them precisely onto a target board to rebuild a structure.

Input: Randomly placed LEGO blocks on a base plate

Output: Rearranged and attached to a new location based on predefined layout
