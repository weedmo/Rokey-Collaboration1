## ‚öôÔ∏è Doosan Robot move gear

This project demonstrates a simple **Pick & Place** system using the **Doosan M0609** collaborative robot.

The robot picks up 4 gears from predefined positions and places them at corresponding target positions using optional **force control** for accurate placement.

## üìã Features
- Uses `movej`, `movel`, `amove_periodic` for movement
- `force control` is applied optionally during placement
- Position list is hardcoded for simplicity
- Includes digital output control for gripping (`grip()` / `release()`)

## üîß How It Works
1. Robot moves to home position
2. Picks up gears from 4 source poses
3. Places each gear at its corresponding target pose
4. Uses force-based contact detection during placement to ensure correct attachment

## üöÄ Run

```bash
ros2 run assignment move_gear
```
## ü¶æ Doosan Robot move block

This project demonstrates a **Pick & Place system** using the **Doosan M0609 collaborative robot**.  
The robot detects the Z-contact point of each block using **force sensing**, and then sorts the blocks into columns based on height.

- **Input**: 3x3 block grid  
- **Output**: Sorted into 3 columns based on contact height (`z`)

### demo run
```bash
ros2 run assignment move_block
```
## üß±ü§ñ Doosan Robot LEGO
This project demonstrates a Pick & Place system using the Doosan M0609 collaborative robot.
The robot picks up LEGO blocks using force sensing to detect contact, then places them precisely onto a target board to rebuild a structure.

Input: Randomly placed LEGO blocks on a base plate

Output: Rearranged and attached to a new location based on predefined layout
